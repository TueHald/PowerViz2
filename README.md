# PowerViz2
### Reimplementation of the PowerViz visualisation tool

PowerViz2 is an HTML5 re-implementation of the PowerViz electricity consumption ambient display application.
The backend (server and data-collecting mechanism) will stay largely untouched, while the frontend display will be rewritten using HTML5 and TypeScript.
